<h1><strong>Roaming The Sunflower Fields</strong></h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">Ok, I'll admit it, I'm a city girl. I know most people not from the midwest would think (um, you're from the midwest), but seriously Kansas City is a real city, like we have a downtown, lights, a streetcar, and highrises, etc. It's not like New York or Chicago, but it's definitely city life.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Lately, I'd seen everyone from the midwest on my social media timelines with these beautiful pictures in sunflower fields. I had a bright idea to take my nieces and nephew to experience something new and we'd go visit a farm.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, we hopped in the car and drove an hour away to go on a farm tour. On the way to the farm we passed various (farms I assume) that had cows and horses. Every time we passed a farm the kids would point and say, "Look that's a cow!" or "Look that's a horse!"</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As soon as we got to the farm we were greeted with a mixture of smells, my nieces and nephew being city kids yelled out, "Ewwww, it STINKS Ti-ti!" "OMG, what is that smell." I'm like, ya'll we're on a farm it's going to stink.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Needless to say, they didn't like being on the farm too long. They pet a few animals but were intrigued by the huge sunflower field across the street. So we made our way over to the field and spent a long time walking through and exploring the field. I was half scared that the little one would get lost, but she was determined to keep up with her siblings.</p>

The kids had a great time, we all got to experience a taste of the country and afterwards enjoyed lunch at a restaurant in the nearest town. I guess our outing was a success. The next time maybe we'll day trip to somewhere like St. Louis (non-midwesterners it's also a real city). I hightly suggest you take a short trip to the sunflower fields. Your family will love it and you might learn something new.
